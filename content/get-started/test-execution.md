# Test execution

If you are using IDE to run tests locally it may ignore Allure
configuration specified in build file (as IntelliJ IDEA does). In order
to make it work consider using allure.properties file to configure
Allure. Check out [configuration section](/allure/java/cucumber-jvm) for more
information.

Before building a report you need to run your tests to obtain some basic
test report data. Typically it might be a junit-style xml report
generated by nearly every popular test framework. For example, suppose
you have test reports automatically created by surefire maven plugin
stored in the `target/surefire-reports`:
