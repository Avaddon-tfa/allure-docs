# Overview page

Entry point for every report would be the 'Overview' page with
dashboards and widgets:

![Overview](../../images/tab_overview.png)

Overview page hosts several default widgets representing basic
characteristics of your project and test environment.

-   Statistics - overall report statistics.

-   Launches - if this report represents several test launches,
    statistics per launch will be shown here.

-   Behaviors - information on results aggregated according to stories
    and features.

-   Executors - information on test executors that were used to run the
    tests.

-   History Trend - if tests accumulated some historical data, it’s
    trend will be calculated and shown on the graph.

-   Environment - information on test environment (see [how to define environment](/allure/features/environment)).

Home page widgets are draggable and configurable. Also, Allure supports
it’s own plugin system, so quite different widget layouts are possible.

Navigation bar is collapsible and enables you to switch into several of
the basic results overview modes.
