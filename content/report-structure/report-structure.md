# Report structure

Once youâ€™ve got the idea what the report does look like. You will
probably want to get more data-rich reports. You might have to consider
using one of the Allure adaptors for your testing framework, which will
allow to collect much more information. Jump to the integrations section
to learn more about integration with testing frameworks.

Typical report consists of 'Overview' tab, navigation bar, several tabs
for different kinds of test data representation and test case pages for
each individual test. Each Allure report is backed by a tree-like data
structure, that represents a test execution process. Different tabs
allow to switch between the views of the original data structure thus
giving a different perspective. Note that all tree-like representations
including Behaviors, Categories, xUnit and Packages support filtering
and are sortable.
