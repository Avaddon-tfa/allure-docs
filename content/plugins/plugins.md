# Allure Plugins System

Allure is designed to be highly customizable, because practice shows
that many teams across the world may have different metrics, or may have
developed unique approaches for testing, their products might demand
something completely different to the initial requirements Allure was
built to comply. To deal with this kinds of challenges Allure has a
plugin system, that gives a lot of flexibility to the report
representation.

To be precise, all of the basic functionality is modularized into
plugins, and it would be too lengthy to list them all here. But nearly
every feature described in the features section \[link to allure
features section\] is implemented internally as a plugin.
